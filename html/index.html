    <div id="aboutBlurb">
        <p>My name is Everton Smith, and I have been a professional Software Developer for 5 years.</p>
        <p>From a young age I was interested in technology and video games. Combining this with a love of Math and Science, I ended up pursuing a B.Sc in Computer Science from UBC Okanagan.</p>
        <p>Since graduating in 2019, I have been working for Kronos/UKG as a developer in their scheduling department.</p>
        <p>Outside of work, I enjoy creating new content for and modding existing games. I also enjoy learning different software languages and frameworks.</p>
